# Stream API Examples

This repository contains examples and code snippets demonstrating the use of Java Stream API.

## Overview

Java Stream API, introduced in Java 8, provides a powerful and functional approach to process collections of objects. It allows you to perform aggregate operations on data in a concise and readable manner.

This repository contains various examples illustrating the usage of Java Stream API for common tasks such as filtering, mapping, reducing, and grouping elements.

## Examples

Here are some examples included in this repository:

- Basic stream creation and operations
- Filtering elements using predicates
- Mapping elements to different types
- Reducing elements to a single value
- Grouping elements by a key
- Partitioning elements into true/false conditions
- Performing parallel processing with streams

Each example comes with detailed explanations and code snippets to help you understand and apply the concepts effectively.
